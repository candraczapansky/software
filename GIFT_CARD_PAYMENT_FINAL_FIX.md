# 🔧 **Gift Card Payment - Final Fix Guide**

## 🚨 **Current Issue**
The gift card payment system is showing success messages but not actually processing payments because the Helcim API token is not being recognized by the server.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Helcim API Token Not Set**: The server is not receiving the `HELCIM_API_TOKEN` environment variable
2. **Mock Responses**: The Helcim service falls back to mock responses when no API token is found
3. **Payment Appears Successful**: The UI shows success but no actual charge is made

## ✅ **Complete Solution**

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Helcim Configuration
HELCIM_API_TOKEN=aLWelMKkFYVQd%h9zDbS%N84EtS@Qj!Vjhn_5VlqkzFaKiH7d3Zb.v@BG3RXEkhb
HELCIM_API_URL=https://api.helcim.com/v1

# Other required environment variables
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=hello@headspaglo.com
```

### **Step 2: Start Server with Environment Variables**

```bash
# Method 1: Using the provided script
chmod +x start-server-with-helcim.sh
./start-server-with-helcim.sh

# Method 2: Manual export
export HELCIM_API_TOKEN='aLWelMKkFYVQd%h9zDbS%N84EtS@Qj!Vjhn_5VlqkzFaKiH7d3Zb.v@BG3RXEkhb'
export HELCIM_API_URL='https://api.helcim.com/v1'
npm start
```

### **Step 3: Verify Helcim Integration**

Run the test script to verify the integration:

```bash
node fix-helcim-integration.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Helcim API test successful!
✅ Server payment test successful!
🎉 All tests passed! Helcim integration is working.
```

### **Step 4: Test Real Payment Flow**

1. **Navigate to Gift Certificates page**
2. **Fill out the form with test card data:**
   - Card Number: `4111111111111111`
   - Expiry: `12/2025`
   - CVV: `123`
3. **Submit the payment**
4. **Check the server logs for breadcrumb messages**

### **Step 5: Monitor Payment Processing**

**Look for these breadcrumb messages in server logs:**

```
💳 BREADCRUMB 1: Payment request received
💳 BREADCRUMB 2: Preparing Helcim payment data
💳 BREADCRUMB 3: Helcim payment data prepared
💳 BREADCRUMB 4: Making Helcim API payment request
💳 BREADCRUMB 5: Helcim API response received
✅ BREADCRUMB 6: Helcim payment verified as successful
💳 BREADCRUMB 7: Saving payment record to database
✅ BREADCRUMB 9: Payment record saved to database
✅ BREADCRUMB 10: Payment process completed successfully
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue 1: Server still using mock responses**

**Symptoms:**
- Response shows `"squarePayment"` instead of `"helcimPayment"`
- No breadcrumb logs about Helcim API calls

**Solution:**
1. Stop the server
2. Set environment variables: `export HELCIM_API_TOKEN='your_token'`
3. Restart server: `npm start`
4. Check server startup logs for "Helcim API token not found" message

### **Issue 2: Helcim API returns 404**

**Symptoms:**
- Helcim API test fails with 404 error
- Payment processing fails

**Solution:**
1. Verify the Helcim API URL is correct
2. Check if the API token has proper permissions
3. Contact Helcim support for API access

### **Issue 3: Payment succeeds but no charge appears**

**Symptoms:**
- Payment shows success in UI
- No charge on bank statement
- Server logs show successful payment

**Solution:**
1. Check Helcim dashboard for transaction records
2. Verify the payment was actually processed
3. Check if using test vs production environment

## 📊 **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Server starts without "Helcim API token not found" warning
- [ ] Payment endpoint returns `helcimPayment` instead of `squarePayment`
- [ ] Breadcrumb logs show Helcim API calls
- [ ] Gift certificate purchase completes successfully
- [ ] Payment appears in Helcim dashboard
