# 🔧 Candra Calendar Display Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
Candra Czapansky had schedules set for the "GloUp" location, but she wasn't appearing in the calendar or staff filter dropdown for that location. The issue was a mismatch between her staff record location assignment and her schedule locations.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. Staff Record Location Mismatch**
- **Candra's staff record**: Had `locationId: NULL` initially, then was set to location 1 (Glo Head Spa)
- **Candra's schedules**: Were assigned to location 11 (GloUp)
- **Result**: Staff API filtering by location wasn't finding Candra for GloUp location

### **2. Database State Before Fix**
```
👨‍💼 All staff records:
  - candra  czapansky: Staff ID 61, Location: NULL (null)

📅 All schedules:
  - candra  czapansky: Friday 09:00-17:00, Location: GloUp  (11)
  - candra  czapansky: Monday 09:00-17:00, Location: GloUp  (11)
  - candra  czapansky: Sunday 09:00-17:00, Location: GloUp  (11)
  - candra  czapansky: Wednesday 09:00-17:00, Location: GloUp  (11)
```

### **3. API Behavior**
- **Staff API**: Filtered by `locationId`, so Candra wasn't returned for GloUp location
- **Schedules API**: Worked correctly, returning schedules for GloUp location
- **Calendar**: Couldn't display Candra because she wasn't in the staff list for GloUp

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Updated Staff Record Location**
```sql
UPDATE staff 
SET location_id = 11
WHERE id = 61
```

### **2. Verification Results**
```
✅ Updated Candra's location to: GloUp (ID: 11)

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**
