=== Permission System Implementation Guide ===

1. The permission system implementation is now complete. Here's how it works:

   a) Each staff user can be assigned to one or more permission groups
   b) Each permission group contains a set of permissions
   c) The sidebar in client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx now uses PermissionGuard components
      to conditionally show menu items based on user permissions
   d) Routes in App.tsx are protected with ProtectedRoute components

2. The following files were created:
   
   - client/src/hooks/use-user-permissions.ts: Hook to fetch and check user permissions
   - client/src/components/permissions/PermissionGuard.tsx: Component for conditional UI rendering
   - client/src/components/permissions/ProtectedRoute.tsx: Component for route protection

3. Test with these permission groups:
   
   - Admin: Full access to everything
   - Full Staff: Access to everything except permissions management
   - Basic Staff: Access to core features only
   - Reception: Focus on appointments and client management
   - Reports Only: Limited to dashboard and reports

4. To test with different users:
   
   a) Use your existing permission management UI to create these permission groups
   b) Create test users and assign them to different groups
   c) Log in with each user to verify the correct visibility

The permission system ensures that staff members only see what they're allowed to access.
