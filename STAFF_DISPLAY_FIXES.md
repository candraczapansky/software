# Staff Display Fixes in Booking Flow

## Issue Fixed

The staff selection step (step 3) in the booking flow wasn't displaying any staff members after selecting a service. This has been fixed by making several changes to the staff loading and filtering logic.

## Changes Made

1. **Direct Staff Loading for Location**
   - Modified staff fetching to directly use the location filter parameter in the API call
   - Added better error handling and logging for staff loading

2. **More Permissive Staff Display Logic**
   - Completely reworked the staff filtering to ensure staff members always appear on step 3
   - On the staff selection step, we now show ALL staff at the location without filtering by service
   - Added fallbacks to ensure staff display even if service assignments aren't loaded yet

3. **Enhanced UI for Staff Selection**
   - Always show the "Any available staff" option
   - Added a loading indicator when staff are being fetched
   - Improved the empty state message when truly no staff are available

4. **Debugging Tools**
   - Added extensive console logging to track staff filtering decisions
   - Log staff counts, filtering criteria, and fallback conditions
   - These logs can help diagnose any future issues

## Implementation Details

### Staff Query Changes

Staff are now loaded with a direct location parameter:
```typescript
const res = await apiRequest('GET', selectedLocationId ? `/api/staff?locationId=${selectedLocationId}` : '/api/staff');
```

### Staff Filtering Logic

For the staff selection step (step 3), we now use this logic:
```typescript
// On staff selection step, show ALL staff at location without service filtering
if (currentStep === 2) {
  return (staff as any[]).map((staffMember: any) => {
    const staffSchedules = Array.isArray(schedules) 
      ? (schedules as any[]).filter((sch: any) => sch.staffId === staffMember.id)
      : [];
    return {
      ...staffMember,
      schedules: staffSchedules
    };
  });
}
```

### UI Improvements

- Always show the "Any available staff" option regardless of filtered staff count
- Added a loading state with spinner while staff are being loaded
- Improved error messages for true empty states

## Testing

Please test the booking flow by:
1. Going to the booking page at your URL
2. Select a location
3. Select a service category and service
4. Verify staff members appear on step 3
5. Each staff card should show their name, username, and schedule information
