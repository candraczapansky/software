# 🔑 How to Enable Real Helcim Payments

## 📋 **Current Problem**
Your Helcim API token has **Transaction Processing: None** which blocks all payment processing.

## ✅ **Steps to Fix (From Your Admin Panel)**

### 1. **Update API Access Permissions**
In your Helcim admin panel (that you have open):

1. **Change "Transaction Processing" from "None" to "Full Access"**
2. **Change "General" from "No Access" to "Read" or "Full Access"** 
3. **Click "Create" or "Update"** to generate new token
4. **Copy the new API token**

### 2. **Update Your App with New Token**
Once you have the new token, update it in your environment:

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable
export HELCIM_API_TOKEN="your_new_token_here"

# Option 2: Update the hardcoded token in the service file
```

### 3. **Test Real Payments**
After updating permissions:

1. Go to the POS page 
2. Click "🧪 Test Helcim Popup" button
3. The popup will now use REAL Helcim payment processing instead of demo mode

## 🎯 **What Each Permission Does**

- **Transaction Processing: Full Access** = Can process real payments + HelcimPay popup
- **General: Read/Full Access** = Can access basic API functions
- **Settings: No Access** = Fine for payments (you don't need this)

## 🚀 **Expected Results After Fix**

✅ Real Helcim payment popup opens  
✅ Customers can enter real card details  
✅ Real charges process through your Helcim account  
✅ Server logs show "Real Helcim Pay session initialized"  
❌ No more demo/mock sessions  

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working**

After updating permissions, check the server logs when testing:

**Before fix (current):**
```
⚠️  API Token Permissions Issue Detected
Using mock payment session for demonstration purposes
```

**After fix (goal):**
```
✅ Real Helcim Pay session initialized successfully
Session ID: real_helcim_session_12345
```

## 💡 **Why This Happened**

The API token you're using was created with limited permissions. This is actually a security feature - Helcim doesn't give full payment processing access by default. You need to explicitly enable it in the admin panel.

**The popup modal implementation is 100% correct** - it just needs an API token with the right permissions to work with real Helcim servers instead of demo mode.
