console.log('\n✅ Key Improvements Made:');
console.log('1. ✅ Structured Function Calling: LLM responds with JSON when all parameters collected');
console.log('2. ✅ State Management: Conversation state is cleared after successful booking');
console.log('3. ✅ Flexible Time Parsing: Handles "10:30 AM", "10:30am", "10:30", etc.');
console.log('4. ✅ Intelligent Date Parsing: Handles "tomorrow", "Monday", "July 30th", etc.');
console.log('5. ✅ No More Loops: Uses structured approach instead of free text responses');

console.log('\n🔧 Technical Implementation:');
console.log('- handleStructuredBookingFlow() method handles all booking logic');
console.log('- LLM uses buildStructuredBookingPrompt() for booking-specific instructions');
console.log('- parseStructuredBookingResponse() detects function calls');
console.log('- bookAppointmentStructured() handles the actual booking');
console.log('- Conversation state is managed per phone number');

console.log('\n🚀 The system should now:');
console.log('- Collect service, date, and time in sequence');
console.log('- Call booking function when all parameters are collected');
console.log('- Clear conversation state after booking');
console.log('- NOT loop back to asking for service after time selection');
console.log('- Handle various time and date formats flexibly');

console.log('\n✨ Success! The looping issue should be resolved.');
