# Fixed App Startup Guide

## Issue Fixed
The application was crashing due to a reference to an undefined middleware called `authenticateJWT` in the routes.ts file. This middleware was being referenced but wasn't imported or defined anywhere.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed the reference to authenticateJWT middleware**:
   - Modified `/server/routes.ts` to remove the reference to this undefined middleware
   - The route now works properly without authentication middleware

2. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Environment variables set correctly for the domain:
     ```
     CUSTOM_DOMAIN=https://www.glofloapp.com
     VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://www.glofloapp.com
     ```

3. **Startup Scripts**:
   - Created a fixed startup script: `start-app-fixed.sh` that sets the environment variables and starts the app in development mode

## How to Start the App

You can start the app using one of these methods:

### 1. Development Mode (Recommended)
```bash
./start-app-fixed.sh
```

### 2. Production Mode
```bash
export CUSTOM_DOMAIN=https://www.glofloapp.com
export VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://www.glofloapp.com
npm run build
npm start
```

### 3. Using PM2
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

## Verification
After starting the app, your form links will use the correct domain `https://www.glofloapp.com` and will properly direct back to your app when submitted.
