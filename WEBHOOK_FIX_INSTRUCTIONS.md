# ðŸš¨ WEBHOOK FIX - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND!

## The Problem
**Your webhook is configured to go to `gloheadspa.app` but you're testing on Replit!**

When you process a payment on your Replit development environment, Helcim sends the webhook to your production site (`gloheadspa.app`), NOT to your Replit app. That's why payments succeed but your dev app never knows about it.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Update Helcim Webhook URL (For Development Testing)

1. **Log into Helcim**
2. Go to **All Tools** â†’ **Integrations** â†’ **Webhooks**
3. **Change the Deliver URL to your Replit URL:**
   ```
   https://47af059e-e7df-4462-a4ea-be61df9b2343-00-16m9j5e89xdj.kirk.replit.dev/api/helcim/webhook
   ```
4. **Save** the settings
5. **Test a payment** - it should work now!

### Option 2: Use Separate Helcim Accounts

For a cleaner setup, consider:
- **Production Helcim Account** â†’ Webhook to `gloheadspa.app`
- **Test/Dev Helcim Account** â†’ Webhook to your Replit URL

### Option 3: Manual Testing Workaround

If you can't change the webhook URL:

1. Process the payment on the terminal
2. Note the transaction ID from the terminal screen
3. Manually trigger the webhook in your dev environment:

```javascript
// In your browser console or a test script:
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/helcim/webhook', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'webhook-signature': 'v1,test',
    'webhook-timestamp': Date.now().toString(),
    'webhook-id': 'msg_test_' + Date.now()
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID_HERE',
    type: 'cardTransaction'
  })
})
```

## Important Notes

### For Production Deployment:
Before going live, make sure to:
1. Change the webhook URL back to `https://gloheadspa.app/api/helcim/webhook`
2. Test thoroughly on the production domain
3. Ensure HTTPS is working (required by Helcim)

### Multiple Environments:
If you need to test in multiple environments, you could:
1. Use environment-specific Helcim API tokens
2. Set up webhook forwarding services
3. Use ngrok for local development

## Quick Test After Fixing

Once you update the webhook URL in Helcim:

1. Run a test payment on your Smart Terminal
2. Check your Replit console - you should see:
   ```
   ðŸŸ¢ POST /api/helcim/webhook
   ðŸ“¥ Helcim webhook received
   ðŸŽ¯ Processing cardTransaction webhook
   âœ… Webhook processing complete
   ```
3. Your app should show "Payment Successful" instead of endless loading

## Webhook URL Requirements Reminder

- âœ… Must use HTTPS (Replit provides this)
- âœ… Cannot contain the word "Helcim" in the URL
- âœ… Must respond with 200 OK status
- âœ… Should respond quickly (within a few seconds)
