# Database Cleanup Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: When you deleted services, staff members, or schedules, they would reappear after server restarts because the system was automatically recreating sample data during initialization.

**Root Cause**: The `initializeSampleData()` method in `server/storage.ts` was running every time the server started and recreating sample data if it didn't find existing data.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Database Cleanup Script** (`cleanup-database.js`)
- **Purpose**: Properly removes all sample data from the database
- **What it does**:
  - Deletes all services (except those with active appointments)
  - Deletes all staff members (except admin user)
  - Deletes all staff schedules
  - Deletes all staff-service assignments
  - Sets a flag to prevent future sample data recreation

### 2. **Sample Data Prevention** (Modified `server/storage.ts`)
- **Added**: Check for `sample_data_initialized` flag before creating sample data
- **Added**: Automatic flag setting after successful initialization
- **Result**: Sample data is only created once, never recreated

### 3. **Staff Creation Fix** (Modified `client/src/components/staff/staff-form.tsx`)
- **Fixed**: User ID access from nested API response structure
- **Result**: Staff creation now works without "Bad Request" errors

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Run the Cleanup Script
```bash
node cleanup-database.js
```

This will:
- Remove all sample services, staff, and schedules
- Set a flag to prevent recreation
- Show you exactly what was deleted

### Step 2: Restart Your Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

### Step 3: Verify Cleanup
```bash
node test-no-sample-data.js
```

This will confirm that no sample data was recreated.

### Step 4: Create Your Own Data
Now you can create your own:
- Services through the web interface
- Staff members through the web interface
- Staff schedules through the API or web interface
- Staff-service assignments

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### ✅ **Services**
- **Before**: Sample services like "Signature Head Spa", "Women's Haircut & Style" would reappear
- **After**: Services stay deleted permanently

### ✅ **Staff Members**
- **Before**: Sample staff like "Emma Martinez" would reappear
- **After**: Staff members stay deleted permanently (except admin)

### ✅ **Staff Schedules**
- **Before**: Sample schedules would reappear
- **After**: Schedules stay deleted permanently

### ✅ **Staff Services**
- **Before**: Sample staff-service assignments would reappear
- **After**: Assignments stay deleted permanently

### ✅ **Staff Creation**
- **Before**: "Bad Request" error when creating new staff
- **After**: Staff creation works correctly

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Flag System
The system now uses a `sample_data_initialized` flag stored in the `system_config` table:

```javascript
// Check if sample data has already been initialized
const sampleDataFlag = await this.getSystemConfig('sample_data_initialized');
if (sampleDataFlag && sampleDataFlag.value === 'true') {
  console.log('Sample data initialization skipped - flag indicates it has already been initialized');
  return;
}
```

### API Response Fix
The staff creation API returns user data in a nested structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "id": 27943,
    "username": "teststaff...",
    "email": "teststaff...@example.com"
  }
}
```

The frontend now correctly accesses `user.user.id` instead of `user.id`.

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### If You Need to Reset Sample Data
If you ever want to allow sample data recreation (for testing, etc.):

1. Delete the flag:
```bash
# Via API or database
DELETE FROM system_config WHERE key = 'sample_data_initialized';
```

2. Restart the server - sample data will be recreated

### If You Need to Clean Up Again
Simply run the cleanup script again:
```bash
node cleanup-database.js
```

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Permanent Deletions**: Deleted items stay deleted
2. **Clean Database**: No unwanted sample data
3. **Working Staff Creation**: Can create new staff members
4. **SMS Booking Ready**: Can set up proper services and staff for SMS booking
5. **Production Ready**: Database behaves like a production system

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the server logs for initialization messages
2. Verify the `sample_data_initialized` flag exists in the database
3. Run the test script to verify the current state
4. The cleanup script can be run multiple times safely

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Database cleanup and sample data prevention is now fully functional.
