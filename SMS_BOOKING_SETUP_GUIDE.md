# SMS Booking Setup Guide

## Overview

The SMS auto-responder has been successfully configured to handle appointment booking requests. This guide explains how the system works and how to use it.

## How It Works

### 1. SMS Auto-Responder Flow

When a client sends an SMS to your configured phone number, the system:

1. **Detects Booking Intent**: Analyzes the message for booking-related keywords
2. **Parses Service Requests**: Identifies which service the client wants
3. **Finds Available Slots**: Checks staff schedules and existing appointments
4. **Provides Available Times**: Sends back available appointment times
5. **Handles Booking**: Books the appointment when client confirms

### 2. Conversation Flow

```
Client: "Hi, I would like to book an appointment"
System: "Great! I'd love to help you book an appointment. We offer: Signature Head Spa ($99), Deluxe Head Spa ($160), Platinum Head Spa ($220), Korean Glass Skin Facial ($130), Buccal Massage Facial ($190). Which service would you like to book? üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®"

Client: "Signature Head Spa"
System: "Great choice! Here are some available times for Signature Head Spa: 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 3:00 PM. Which time works best for you? üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®"

Client: "2:00 PM"
System: "Perfect! I've booked your Signature Head Spa appointment for [date] at 2:00 PM. You'll receive a confirmation shortly. See you soon! üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®"
```

## Configuration Options

### SMS Auto-Responder Settings

The system can be configured through the API:

```bash
# Update confidence threshold
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/sms-auto-respond/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"confidenceThreshold": 0.7}'

# Update phone numbers
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/sms-auto-respond/phone-numbers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumbers": ["+19187277348"]}'
```

### Business Hours

Configure business hours to only respond during specific times:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/sms-auto-respond/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businessHoursOnly": true,
    "businessHours": {

      "end": "17:00",
      "timezone": "America/Chicago"
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No available slots"**: 
   - Check staff schedules are configured
   - Verify services are assigned to staff
   - Check for conflicting appointments

2. **SMS not responding**:
   - Verify phone number is in auto-respond list
   - Check SMS auto-responder is enabled
   - Review server logs for errors

3. **Wrong service detected**:
   - Check service name matching in `parseBookingRequest`
   - Verify service names in database
