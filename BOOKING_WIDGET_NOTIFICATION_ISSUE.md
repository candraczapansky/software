# Booking Widget Notification Issue - Summary

## Current Status
The booking widget is successfully creating appointments, but SMS and email confirmations are NOT being sent.

## What's Working
‚úÖ Appointment creation from widget works
‚úÖ The appointment data includes `bookingMethod: 'widget'`
‚úÖ The client is found (ID: 22624)
‚úÖ Payment card saving works

## The Problem
The notification code in the server is NOT being executed. We can see from the browser console that appointments are created (`Appointment created: {id: 4616...}`), but there are NO server logs showing:
- The appointment request being received
- The confirmation code being reached
- Notifications being sent

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Server Logs Not Visible
The server logs might not be output to your terminal. Check where your server process is running and ensure you can see its console output.

### 2. Error Before Notification Code
There might be an error occurring after appointment creation but before the notification code runs. This could be:
- A database error when fetching client/staff/service data
- An async/await issue
- An uncaught exception

### 3. Different Endpoint Being Used
The widget might be using a different endpoint that doesn't have the notification code.

## What We've Fixed So Far

1. ‚úÖ Preserved `bookingMethod: 'widget'` from being overwritten
2. ‚úÖ Added special handling for widget bookings to always send notifications
3. ‚úÖ Added extensive debugging logs to track the flow

## How to Debug

### Check Server Console
You need to see the actual server console output. When an appointment is created, you should see:
```
üîç [APPOINTMENT API] Received appointment request: ...
‚úÖ CONFIRMATION CODE IS REACHED ‚úÖ
üì± [NOTIFICATION CHECK] About to send notifications: ...
```

### Where to Look for Server Logs
1. **Terminal/Console** where you started the server
2. **PM2 logs** if using PM2: `pm2 logs`
3. **Docker logs** if using Docker: `docker logs <container-name>`
4. **System logs**: `journalctl -u <service-name> -f`
5. **Log files**: Check `/home/runner/workspace/logs/`

### Test Directly
Run this in your browser console to test the API directly:
```javascript
fetch('/api/appointments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    clientId: 22624,
    serviceId: 104,
    staffId: 6,
    locationId: 4,
    startTime: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000).toISOString(),
    endTime: new Date(Date.now() + 90000000).toISOString(),
    status: 'confirmed',
    paymentStatus: 'unpaid',
    bookingMethod: 'widget',
    notes: 'TEST - Should send notifications'
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

## The Core Issue
**The notification code is not being executed on the server.** We need to:
1. Find where the server logs are actually being output
2. Check if there's an error preventing the notification code from running
3. Ensure the correct endpoint is being called

## Next Steps
1. **Find your server console/logs** - This is critical to see what's happening
2. **Check for errors** in the server startup or during appointment creation
3. **Verify the server is running** the updated code with our fixes
4. **Restart the server** if needed to ensure latest changes are loaded
