# Booking Flow Filtering Fix Revision

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed Service Filtering**
   - Made service filtering more permissive by combining services from both backend filtering and staff assignments
   - Added fallbacks to ensure services always display even in edge cases
   - Enhanced logging to help diagnose filtering issues

2. **Fixed Staff Availability Display**
   - Implemented more robust staff filtering that respects location and service assignments
   - Added fallback to show all staff at location if no specific matches are found
   - Improved schedule display to handle missing data gracefully

3. **Enhanced Category Filtering**
   - Made category filtering more permissive to show all relevant categories
   - Added combined approach using both direct location filtering and staff-based filtering
   - Ensured categories will still show even with edge case timing issues

## Technical Details

### Service Filtering Logic

1. **Combined Services Approach**
   - Now properly merges services from both:
     - Backend location-specific services endpoint
     - Staff service assignments at the location
   - Deduplicates to avoid duplicated services

2. **More Robust Staff Filtering**
   - Added fallbacks for timing edge cases
   - Better logging for diagnostic purposes
   - Graceful handling of missing schedule data

3. **Permissive Category Display**
   - Categories now display if EITHER:
     - Backend location filtering includes the category
     - Staff at the location can provide services in that category
   - This ensures we don't accidentally hide all categories

## Debug Info

The code now includes extensive console logging to help diagnose any issues:
- Service filtering decisions
- Staff filtering decisions with detailed criteria
- Category availability information
- Timing of data loading and state changes

## Testing

The booking flow should now correctly:
1. Show service categories available at the selected location
2. Show services within each category that can be performed at the location
3. Show staff members who can perform the selected service at that location
4. Display staff schedules when available

Please report any further issues so we can continue to refine the booking flow.
