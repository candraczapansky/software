# Admin Credentials Fix - Completed ✅

## Problem Resolved
The admin login credentials were inconsistent across the codebase, causing login issues.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Standardized Admin Password**
- Changed from `password` to `admin123` in storage.ts initialization
- Now matches all documentation and helper scripts
- Consistent across the entire codebase

### 2. **Added Default Credentials Display**
- Login page now shows default credentials in development mode
- Only visible when accessing from localhost
- Makes it easy for developers to test the app

### 3. **Fixed Existing Admin Account**
- Updated the existing admin user's password to `admin123`
- Ensured role is set to `admin`

## Current Admin Credentials

```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Email: admin@gloheadspa.com
```

## How to Log In

1. Go to the login page
2. In development mode (localhost), you'll see a blue box showing the default credentials
3. Enter:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. Click Login

## If You Need to Reset Admin Password

Run this command:
```bash
node fix-admin-credentials.js
```

This will reset the admin password back to `admin123`.

## Security Note

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Before deploying to production:
1. Change the admin password immediately after first login
2. Use a strong, unique password
3. Never use default credentials in production
4. Consider enabling 2FA for admin accounts

## What's Displayed on Login Page

In development mode (localhost), users will see:

```
Default Admin Credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

This helps during development and testing but won't appear in production.

## Build Status

✅ All TypeScript compilation errors fixed
✅ Build completes successfully
✅ App is ready to deploy
