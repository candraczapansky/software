# SMS Auto-Responder - Final Improvements Complete ✅

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The SMS auto-responder was giving inappropriate, sales-focused responses to simple greetings like "Hi". Users were getting pushy service offerings when they just wanted to say hello.

## ✅ **Final Fix Applied**

### **Before (Problematic Response):**
```
"Hi SMS Client! Thanks for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you book an appointment or answer any questions. What would you like to know? 💆‍♀️✨"
```

### **After (Natural Response):**
```
"Hi SMS Client! 👋 How can I help you today?"
```
