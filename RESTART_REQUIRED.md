# ⚠️ RESTART REQUIRED

## The recurring appointments feature is now complete!

### What was fixed:
1. ✅ Added `recurringGroupId` field to the correct schema file (`shared/schema.ts`)
2. ✅ Updated the insert schema to accept `recurringGroupId`
3. ✅ Database migration will automatically add the column on server startup
4. ✅ All UI components are ready to display and manage recurring appointments

### Next Steps:
**You need to restart your application for the changes to take effect:**

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C) and restart:
npm run dev
```

### How to test:
1. Create a new recurring appointment series (with recurring checkbox enabled)
2. After creation, click on any appointment in the series
3. You should now see the "Recurring Appointment" card with options to:
   - Edit all future appointments
   - Cancel all future appointments

### What's new:
- **Recurring Appointment Card**: Shows when viewing any appointment that's part of a series
- **Series Statistics**: Displays total appointments, future appointments, and completed count
- **Manage Series Button**: Opens options to edit or cancel all future appointments
- **Edit All Future**: Updates service, staff, and notes for all upcoming appointments
- **Cancel All Future**: Cancels all future appointments in the series

The database will automatically be updated with the new column when you restart the server.
