# Booking Flow Updates

## Changes Made

The online booking flow at gloheadspa.app/booking has been updated to connect services to staff members at specific locations. These changes ensure that when a client selects a location, they will only see services offered by staff members at that location.

### Implementation Details

1. **Location-Specific Services**
   - When a client selects a location, the booking system now filters services to only show those that are:
     - Assigned to staff members who work at the selected location
     - Only available if the staff member has a schedule at that location

2. **Location-Based Category Filtering**
   - Service categories are now also filtered based on location selection
   - Only categories that contain at least one service available at the selected location will be shown

3. **Improved User Experience**
   - Added better messaging when no services are found at a location
   - Clear indication to select a location first to see available services

## How It Works

The booking flow follows these steps:

1. Client selects a location
2. System checks which staff members work at that location based on:
   - Staff assignments to location
   - Staff schedules at that location 
3. System identifies services those staff members are trained to provide
4. Only those services are displayed, grouped by their categories
5. Only categories with available services are shown
6. Client can then select a service, staff member, and appointment time

## Technical Implementation

The changes were made in the `/client/src/components/bookings/booking-widget.tsx` file. The key modifications:

1. Added tracking of available service categories based on staff at location
2. Enhanced filtering of services to consider location-staff-service relationships
3. Improved user feedback messaging when no services are found
4. More efficient service category filtering to only show relevant categories

## Benefits

- Clients will only see services that can actually be provided at their chosen location
- Staff will only receive bookings for services they're trained to offer
- More accurate booking process with fewer potential scheduling conflicts
- Better client experience with less confusion about service availability
