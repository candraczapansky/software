# Booking Flow Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **Location-Specific Service Categories**
   - Fixed: Categories are now properly filtered to only show those with services available at the selected location
   - The system now respects the location restrictions set up in the services admin page

2. **Staff Display and Availability**
   - Fixed: Staff members now correctly appear after selecting a service
   - Added: Staff schedules are displayed directly on staff cards
   - Enhanced: Staff filtering properly connects to location and service availability

## Implementation Details

### Location-Specific Services

- Added a dedicated API query to fetch location-specific services from the backend
- The backend properly filters services based on:
  1. Location-specific service mappings (from the admin page)
  2. Staff assignments at the location
- Implemented an intersection approach to ensure we respect both:
  - Location service restrictions
  - Staff service assignments

### Staff Display and Schedules

- Enhanced staff cards with schedule information
- Added defensive coding to handle missing data
- Added logging to help diagnose any future issues
- Fixed schedule time display formatting

### Service Category Filtering

- Modified category filtering to respect location service mappings
- Added logging to help track category availability decisions
- Ensured categories only appear if they have at least one service at the location

## Technical Changes

1. Added a new API query for location-specific services
2. Modified the staff filtering to include debug logging
3. Enhanced the service filtering logic with useMemo for better performance
4. Fixed schedule display with better error handling

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:
1. Going to the booking page
2. Selecting different locations
3. Verifying only appropriate service categories appear
4. Selecting a service and confirming staff appears with schedule information

## Debugging Information

If you encounter issues in the future, debug logs have been added that show:
- Available staff filtering decisions
- Service category availability
- Service filtering decisions

These logs can be viewed in the browser console to help diagnose any future issues.
