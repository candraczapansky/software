## Testing Commands

### Pre-deployment testing
```bash
# Test Helcim service
node test-helcim-integration.js

# Test complete integration
node test-helcim-complete.js

# Test data migration
node migrate-customer-data.js
```

### Post-deployment testing
```bash
# Test payment processing
curl -X POST http://your-domain/api/create-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 10.00, "sourceId": "cash"}'

# Test customer creation
curl -X POST http://your-domain/api/create-helcim-customer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clientId": 1}'
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered during deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   - Revert to previous deployment
   - Restore old payment processing code
   - Update environment variables

2. **Data Recovery**
   - Restore database from backup
   - Verify customer data integrity
   - Test payment processing

3. **Investigation**
   - Review application logs
   - Check Helcim API responses
   - Identify root cause

4. **Re-deployment**
   - Fix identified issues
   - Re-test in staging environment
