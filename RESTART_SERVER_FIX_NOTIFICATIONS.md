# 🚨 SERVER RESTART REQUIRED - Notification Fix

## The Problem
Your server is running OLD CODE without the notification fixes. The appointments are being created but notifications are NOT being sent because the server hasn't loaded the updated code.

## ✅ Solution: Restart Your Server

### Step 1: Stop Current Server
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
# Find and kill the current server process
pkill -f "tsx server" || pkill -f "npm run dev"
```

Or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

### Step 2: Start Server with Fresh Code
```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Watch for These Logs
When you book through the widget, you should see these in your **SERVER CONSOLE** (not browser):

1. **Incoming Request Log:**
```
🔍 [APPOINTMENT API] Received appointment request: {
  bookingMethod: 'widget',
  ...
}
```

2. **Confirmation Code Reached:**
```
✅ CONFIRMATION CODE IS REACHED ✅
✅ CONFIRMATION CODE IS REACHED ✅
✅ CONFIRMATION CODE IS REACHED ✅
```

3. **Notification Check:**
```
📱 [NOTIFICATION CHECK] About to send notifications: {
  isFromWidget: true,
  ...
}
```

4. **SMS/Email Being Sent:**
```
✅ [SMS] All conditions met, attempting to send SMS confirmation
Sending email confirmation
```

## 🧪 Test After Restart

### Option 1: Test via Browser Console
After restarting, run this in your browser console (F12):
```javascript
fetch('/api/appointments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    clientId: 22624,
    serviceId: 104,
    staffId: 6,
    locationId: 4,
    startTime: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000).toISOString(),
    endTime: new Date(Date.now() + 90000000).toISOString(),
    status: 'confirmed',
    paymentStatus: 'unpaid',
    bookingMethod: 'widget',
    notes: 'TEST - Should trigger notifications'
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

### Option 2: Book Through Widget
Complete a booking through the widget normally and watch the **SERVER CONSOLE** for the logs above.

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Preserved `bookingMethod: 'widget'` (was being overwritten to 'staff')
2. ✅ Added special handling: widget bookings ALWAYS send notifications
3. ✅ Added extensive logging to track the flow

## Important Notes

- **You MUST see the server console output** to verify notifications are being sent
- The browser console only shows client-side logs
- Server logs show the actual notification sending

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check where your server logs are:**
   - Terminal where you started the server
   - PM2 logs: `pm2 logs`
   - Docker logs: `docker logs <container>`
   - Log files: `/home/runner/workspace/logs/`

2. **Ensure Twilio/SendGrid are configured:**
   - Check environment variables are set
   - Verify credentials are correct

3. **Look for errors in server startup:**
   - Any missing modules
   - Database connection issues
   - Port already in use

## The Core Issue
Your server needs to be restarted to load the notification fixes. Once restarted with the new code, widget bookings will trigger SMS and email confirmations.
