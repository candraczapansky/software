üö® ACTION REQUIRED: RESTART YOUR APP
=====================================

The AI responder is READY but your Node.js app needs restart to activate it.

STEP 1: Go to your Replit dashboard
STEP 2: Click the "Stop" button (‚èπÔ∏è)
STEP 3: Wait 2 seconds
STEP 4: Click "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)

After restart, your phone system will work like this:
- Someone calls ‚Üí Yealink phone rings
- Front desk has 10 seconds to answer
- If no answer ‚Üí AI automatically picks up
- Front desk CAN STILL answer during those 10 seconds!

TEST IT:
1. Call your phone number
2. DON'T answer the Yealink
3. After 10 seconds, you'll hear: "Hello! Welcome to our salon..."

The AI is currently running and healthy. Just needs the Node.js restart!
