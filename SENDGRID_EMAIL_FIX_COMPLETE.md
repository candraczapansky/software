# SendGrid Email Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Summary
The SendGrid email functionality was failing because the application was using unverified email addresses as fallback senders. Only `hello@headspaglo.com` was verified in SendGrid, while the code was trying to use:
- `noreply@gloheadspa.com` (unverified)
- `noreply@gloupheadspa.app` (unverified) 
- `notifications@gloupheadspa.app` (unverified)

## ✅ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Updated Verified Senders List
**File:** `server/email.ts`
- Updated `VERIFIED_SENDERS` array to only include `hello@headspaglo.com`
- This is the only email address that is actually verified in SendGrid

### 2. Updated Default Configuration
**File:** `server/config.ts`
- Changed default `fromEmail` from `noreply@gloheadspa.com` to `hello@headspaglo.com`

### 3. Fixed All Route Files
**Files Updated:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Updated all email sending routes
- `server/routes/appointments.ts` - Updated appointment confirmation and reminder emails
- `server/auto-respond-service.ts` - Updated auto-responder emails
- `server/routes/marketing.ts` - Updated marketing emails

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced all instances of unverified email addresses with `hello@headspaglo.com`
- Updated fallback email addresses in all email sending functions

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
**File:** `server/email.ts`
- Improved fallback mechanism to use verified senders
- Added better error logging for email failures
- Enhanced sender verification checks

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS
