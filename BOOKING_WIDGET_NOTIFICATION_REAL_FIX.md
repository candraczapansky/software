# Booking Widget Notification Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## The Real Issue
The booking widget was correctly sending `bookingMethod: 'widget'` in the appointment creation request, BUT the server was **overwriting it to 'staff'** in the appointment creation endpoint.

## Root Cause
In `/server/routes/appointments.ts`, the appointment creation endpoint was hardcoding the `bookingMethod` to 'staff' regardless of what was sent in the request:

```javascript
// BEFORE (BUG):
const enrichedAppointmentData = {
  ...appointmentData,
  bookingMethod: 'staff',  // ← This overwrites the 'widget' value!
  createdBy: currentUser?.id || null
};
```

## The Fix
Modified the appointment creation code to preserve the `bookingMethod` from the request:

```javascript
// AFTER (FIXED):
const enrichedAppointmentData = {
  ...appointmentData,
  bookingMethod: appointmentData.bookingMethod || 'staff',  // Preserve widget bookings
  createdBy: currentUser?.id || null
};
```

This change was made in **3 locations** in the file:
- Line 359: Main appointment creation endpoint
- Line 609: Force create appointment endpoint 
- Line 1250: Recurring appointments creation

## How It Works Now

### When Booking Widget Creates Appointment:
1. Widget sends: `bookingMethod: 'widget'`
2. Server preserves this value
3. Notification logic detects `isFromWidget = true`
4. **Sends confirmations regardless of preferences** ✅

### When Staff Creates Appointment:
1. No `bookingMethod` sent (or `bookingMethod: 'staff'`)
2. Server defaults to 'staff'
3. Notification logic detects `isFromWidget = false`
4. **Respects client preferences** ✅

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Widget bookings always receive confirmations (if contact info exists)
- ✅ Staff bookings respect client notification preferences
- ✅ No data loss or modification to existing functionality
- ✅ All existing appointments, profiles, and settings preserved

## Summary
The issue was not with the notification sending logic or the widget itself, but with the server overwriting the crucial `bookingMethod` field that identifies widget bookings. The fix now properly preserves this field, allowing the notification system to work as intended.
